# moop, a simple pomodoro app.

## Motivation
A lot of the pomodoro apps out there have a lot of personal customization and user tracking, which I find distracting. \
I needed something simple, effective, and visually pleasing so I made it myself.

## Features
- soft bell sound to signal start of break/work
- automatically resets pomodoro round for you
- removes status bar

The timer is shortened below for demonstration purposes. Normally, you would focus for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.
